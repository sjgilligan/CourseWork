#  Use GPIO to Drive LEDs

### Summary

I wired up four leds with resistors to GPIO ports 13, 12, 27, and 33. I then wrote a C program that resets the pins, sets them to output, and then does a continual loop of the pattern assigned. I used a function to do the actual GPIO setting and 1 second delay to reduce the lines of code needed.

#  Battery Voltage Monitor

### Summary

First I wired up the voltage divider, using R1=R2 to divide the voltage in half from 3.3V to around 1.6V. The output voltage goes to GPIO34. The code is based off the example given but sets up the ADC (attentuation increased), a continous while loop with a for loop that records 10 readings every 100ms and then displays the average of those 10 readings every second.

### AI and Open Source Code Assertions

- I have documented in my code readme.md and in my code any
software that we have adopted from elsewhere
